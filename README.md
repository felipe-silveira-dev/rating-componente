**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€

## Giving feedback

The challenge was fun I learned a lot about React and Typescript and also about the Tailwind properties that I didn't know before. I had a lot of fun doing this challenge and I hope you like it.
I added a little bit of animation and new features to the challenge, I hope you like it.
